              Hi there! My name is Kushal Raut, and I&apos;m a software engineer
              specializing in Javascript, React Js, Next Js, Node Js, and
              databases like SQL and No-SQL. With a passion for building
              elegant, user-friendly applications, I&apos;ve spent years honing
              my skills and pushing the limits of what&apos;s possible.
            </p>

            <p className="pb-5">
              I thrive on solving complex problems, and I&apos;m constantly
              seeking out new challenges that can help me grow as an engineer.
              From designing responsive user interfaces to creating scalable,
              performant server-side systems, I&apos;m always pushing myself to
              do better and be better.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whether I&apos;m working on a personal project or collaborating
              with a team, I approach every challenge with creativity,
              enthusiasm, and a focus on delivering real value. And when
              I&apos;m not busy coding, you&apos;ll find me exploring the
              outdoors, reading up on the latest tech trends, or spending time
              with my family and friends.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you&apos;re interested in learning more about my work or
              exploring how we can work together, I&apos;d love to hear from
              you. Thanks for stopping by!
